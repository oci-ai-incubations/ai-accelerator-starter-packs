# ORM Schema Linter

Validate OCI Resource Manager schemas for correctness, catching variable visibility bugs and schema drift before they reach the ORM UI.

## The Core Rule

**Every variable in `vars.tf` that is not universally visible MUST be explicitly listed in `common_schema.yaml` with `visible: false`, then selectively overridden with `visible: true` in category-specific schemas that need it.**

ORM behavior: any variable defined in Terraform that is NOT mentioned in the schema is displayed as a raw field in the ORM UI. This means a variable added to `vars.tf` without a corresponding `visible: false` entry in `common_schema.yaml` will leak into every category's ORM form.

## When to Run

- After adding or renaming any variable in `vars.tf`
- After modifying any schema YAML file
- Before creating an ORM zip (`/integration-test`, `/deploy-and-test`, or manual zip)
- When debugging unexpected fields in the ORM UI
- As part of PR review for changes touching `vars.tf` or `schemas/`

## Validation Steps

### Step 1: Check for Unhidden Variables

Find all variables in `vars.tf` that are NOT mentioned in `common_schema.yaml`:

```bash
cd ai-accelerator-tf

# Extract variable names from vars.tf
grep -oP 'variable\s+"(\K[^"]+)' vars.tf | sort > /tmp/tf_vars.txt

# Extract variable names from common_schema.yaml (under 'variables:' section)
grep -oP '^\s{2}(\K\w+):' schemas/common_schema.yaml | sort > /tmp/schema_vars.txt

# Find variables in TF but not in schema
comm -23 /tmp/tf_vars.txt /tmp/schema_vars.txt
```

**Any output from the last command is a potential bug.** Each listed variable will appear as a raw field in ORM categories that don't explicitly hide it.

### Step 2: Verify Category-Specific Overrides

For variables that should only appear in certain categories, verify the visibility pattern:

```bash
# For each category-specific variable (e.g., cuopt_frontend_enabled):
for category in cuopt vss paas_rag enterprise_rag enterprise_rag_aiq; do
  echo "=== $category ==="
  grep -A2 "cuopt_frontend_enabled" schemas/generated/${category}_schema.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND"
done
```

The correct pattern:
- `common_schema.yaml`: `visible: false` (hidden by default)
- `cuopt_schema.yaml`: `visible: true` (shown only for cuOpt)

### Step 3: Regenerate and Diff

Regenerate all schemas and check for unexpected changes:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null
cd ai-accelerator-tf/schemas
python3 ../create_final_schema.py --all 2>/dev/null || python3 create_final_schema.py --all
```

### Step 4: Run Schema Tests

```bash
pytest ai-accelerator-tf/schemas/tests/ -v
```

### Step 5: Cross-Check Variable Groups

Verify every variable listed in a `variableGroups` section actually exists in the `variables` section:

```bash
# Extract variables referenced in variableGroups
grep -A1 "variables:" schemas/common_schema.yaml | grep "^\s*-" | sed 's/.*- //' | sort > /tmp/group_vars.txt

# Compare with defined variables
comm -23 /tmp/group_vars.txt /tmp/schema_vars.txt
```

Any output means a variable group references an undefined variable.

## Common Bugs

Refer to `references/common-bugs.md` for detailed examples of schema bugs and their fixes.

## Fixing Visibility Bugs

To hide a variable that's leaking into the ORM UI:

1. Add to `common_schema.yaml` under the `variables:` section:
   ```yaml
     variable_name:
       type: string  # match the type in vars.tf
       visible: false
   ```

2. If the variable should be visible in specific categories, add to that category's schema:
   ```yaml
     variable_name:
       visible: true
       title: "Human Readable Title"
       description: "Description for ORM UI"
       required: true  # if needed
   ```

3. Regenerate all schemas and run tests.
